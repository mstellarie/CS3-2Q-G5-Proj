        <h1>How Dead Corpse are not an Exception to Rapists</h1>
        <article>
            <h2>By Twyla Anya P. Estella - Created on November 27, 2024</h2>
            <img src="necrophilia.jpg" width="650" height="400" alt="Image representing necrophilia">
            <p>
                Imagine a world where even in death, one’s body is not their own—a chilling reality that forces us to confront the darkest corners of human behavior. Necrophilia derived from the Greek words “Phillips” (love) and “nekros” (dead body) which basically means, the sexual attraction to corpses. It is one of society’s most taboo and misunderstood behaviors. This can be seen as an extreme form of objectification that disregards the dignity of the deceased and the trauma such actions inflict on their loved ones.
                Legally, necrophilia is criminalized in most countries, considered both a desecration of human remains and an affront to public morality. According to Oxford Human Rights Hub (2023), “the court determined that this act does not qualify as rape under Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (‘IPC’). This is because rape requires the involvement of a human being, and a dead body cannot be considered as such.”
            </p>
            <p>
                This shows that necrophilia is technically not considered as rape, but merely a paraphilic disorder. However, cases often reveal gaps in legal frameworks, with some jurisdictions lacking explicit laws addressing the act. 
                Looking back, necrophilia has been a universal taboo and many legal systems fail to provide a clear and concrete definition of the crime. There are multiple demands to address necrophilia, emphasizing not only punishment but also the importance of recognizing and respecting the deceased. To address this issue, it requires an approach that balances legal frameworks with preventive measures such as spreading awareness and mental health interventions. This helps individuals understand and respect the deceased, reducing the cases of such foul behavior. 
            </p>
            <p>
                To conclude, necrophilia shows how some individuals with psychological disorders present challenges that go beyond societal norms. Addressing this issue does not only require punishment, but demands an approach that helps the person with the psychological disorder, encouraging them to understand that the dead deserve respect and to understand the negative impact on others.
